Summary of Fishers Iris data Set 

Biologist Ronald Fisher developed an analysis of Irish flowers using methods used in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning.    The flowers were all picked and measured the same day.  Fishers data was used to quantify the morphologic variation of three Iris flowers, setosa, virginica and versicolor.  Four features of 150 flowers was measured , 50 of each species, the sepal length and width and petal length and width.   A cluster analysis of the data set is not commonly used as it is not separable without the species information.  Large data sets using Data mining can be used to discover patterns to transform into a comprehensible structure for further use.  Data mining can extract large quantities to discover interesting patterns, unusual records and dependencies and it can be used for further analysis in machine learning and predictive analytics.  Data mining is a good example to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques.  Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant model can be used as the Iris has three different species.
